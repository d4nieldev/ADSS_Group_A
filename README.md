How to start the system?

Wen you start the system it shows a message:
0 - Exit the system.
1 - Login to the system.

If you want to login as an HR manager, please choose 1 and insert the Id 123456789 and password HRmanager.
If you want to login as an Transport manager, please choose 1 and insert the Id 987654321 and password TRANSPORTmanager.
If you want to log in as an employee or a driver - you can do that by using their Id and password.

Each of the users above have a different menu then log in to the system because each one of them have a different functions and access to the system and DataBase.

Hope you will have fun,
Inbar Tal Kfir and Rotem
